# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Enable GitHub Pages First!

The build errors you're seeing are likely because GitHub Pages isn't enabled in your repository settings. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/MindStimulated/eliteluxx-cleaning-services`
2. Click **Settings** tab (at the top right of the repository)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Permissions
1. Still in Settings, go to **Actions** → **General** (in left sidebar)
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions**
3. Select **Read and write permissions**
4. Check **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment
After enabling Pages, push a small change to trigger the workflow:

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "trigger: enable GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 How to Check If It's Working

### Monitor the Deployment:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click on the latest run to see progress
4. Should complete in 2-3 minutes

### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ Build job completes successfully
- ✅ Deploy job completes successfully  
- ✅ Your site will be live at: `https://mindstimulated.github.io/eliteluxx-cleaning-services/`

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Pages not found" or 404
**Solution**: Make sure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source, not "Deploy from a branch"

### Issue: Workflow doesn't trigger
**Solution**: Check that the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and permissions are set correctly

### Issue: Build succeeds but site shows 404
**Solution**: Your base path might be wrong. Check that `vite.config.ts` has:
```typescript
base: '/eliteluxx-cleaning-services/'
```
